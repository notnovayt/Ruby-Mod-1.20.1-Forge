# This is official Forge port for Ruby Mod.
# It is for version 1.20.1 only!!

To install it, simply place the .jar file from the latest release in your .minecraft/mods folder.

Changes from the fabric version: I couldn't make a portal work, so instead you'll have to craft a Ruby Portal Block using the Ruby Staff and then right click it to teleport to the dimension.
